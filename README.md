## Unofficial Script for evaluating Assignments(1-3)

### How To Use

* Clone the repo or download the zip.
* Replace corresponding java files with your files.
* Run command `make clean` followed by `make all`. (Alternatively use `make run`).
* Run java DriverXtreme.java.
* Enter your first name and wait for some time. The program will automatically generate two named input files and generate 2 output files doing over 5 million operations. Then it will automatically compare your output from mine and display the result. Also note this program tests all 4 main functions(Free,Allocate,Defragment,Sanity)

### FAQ

* Q.) Program stuck in loop?
    A.) Ideally it should not take more than 1 minute to run the program. But if it does take it is possible that your algorithm in stuck in loop.(Note even if your getFirst and getNext is bugged the output will be different)
* Q.) My output is different?
    A.) In no way can I guarantee that the output files provided by me are correct. Nonetheless, I have tried to ensure that my output is correct. But if you are confident, that output files are incorrect, please open an issue. You can also compare your outputs with friends, by changing the appropriate files.
   
### For Advanced Users

The program is quite modular in its design, and can be used to generate different test cases in less number of time.I will update this documentation soon.

### How does this Work?

I will update this part soon.

**NOTE:-** This in no way, ensures that your program is correct. This is only a set of randomly generated test cases, and may not include all corner cases.

Enjoy :)
